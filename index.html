            strings: ["The European Environment Agency designates a naturally occurring mass of water whose contents have been permanently altered Heavily Modified Water Bodies (HMWB). <br/><br/> Designation of heavily modified water bodies (WFDUK) { <br/><br/> Water bodies identified as being at significant risk of failing to achieve good ecological status because of modifications to their hydromorphological characteristics resulting from past engineering works, including impounding works, were provisionally identified as heavily modified for the Article 5 report. These are recorded as modified on the WFD characterisation database and there are currently 476 such water bodies in Scotland, and 3301 in England and Wales. In order for a water body to be designated heavily modified evidence is required to show that the water body would not achieve good status without measures being applied in relation to the modifications that have been made to the hydromorphological characteristics. This paper outlines principles for the methodologies the UK will use to identify which of these bodies can be designated without the need for detailed site-specific studies. <br/><br/> To make the case for designation, evidence is required that: <br/><br/> (a) Making the hydromorphological improvements necessary to achieve good status would have a significant adverse effect on the wider environment or on a specified water use; <br/><br/> AND <br/><br/> (b) For reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, there is no significantly better environmental option to reasonably achieve the benefits provided by the modifications. If both criteria are met then the water body should be designated heavily modified. <br/><br/> } <br/><br/> By European Environment Agency (EEA) { <br/><br/>HMWB are bodies of water which as a result of physical alterations by human activity are substantially changed in character and cannot, therefore, meet good ecological status (GES). In this context physical alterations mean changes to e.g. the size, slope, discharge, form and shape of river bed of a water body. <br/><br/> Intensive agriculture, urbanisation, energy production and flood protection have altered European hydrological systems and freshwater habitats for decades. Climate change adds to these challenges (higher water temperature, more floods or water scarcity). Less than half of all water bodies have a 'good status'. <br/><br/> Full and coordinated implementation of water and nature legislation would restore aquatic habitats and foster water efficiency. <br/><br/> The natural capital of water ecosystems is highly intertwined and dependant on the way land and water is managed and how pressures from agriculture, energy, transport etc. are reduced within their respective policy areas or how adaptation to climate change is integrated into water management. <br/><br/> Urban water management has over many years used rivers only as extensions of the sewage system. Urban rivers have been covered, river banks have been heavily developed, and lakes have been isolated or even filled. Impervious sewage collection systems have changed the water flow regime. <br/><br/> } <br/><br/> At the First Bath <br/> Wednesday <br/><br/> Bought entry in giant lobby which connected by turn-style to baths and by blocked off opening to massage room. Walking through the long, submerged tunnel to the locker rooms through blue, cerulean blue portholes where bodies almost flailed -- but with grace there must be a word for that -- to come to lockers in circular room so that paired with walk underwater I had lost my sense of direction -- I was within. Fully. After changing I walked past doors that were blocked off -- the outdoor pools weren’t open. Went down and got in the larger pool which the walk in looks up into. Was told to get out because I needed a swim cap, but I didn’t want to buy one so I went to the warmer wade pool but this was all after I noticed, from the water, the center of the glassed roof had opened up and down the nave to let in the sun. From the warmer wade pool I noticed the beauty of the old building -- a general pall of yellow-gold patched with blue, waves reflected on the ceiling like molten glass flashing like nodes in a neural network in my head. The choir in the ambulatory of the pool were stone lion fish, water blasting out of their mouths to be used for massages. There was a woman supporting a young child learning to swim there, I couldn’t tell whether the kid was a boy or girl, but I wondered. I got out from this pool to look further in the maze of the baths. I walked across the nave and through a door pointing to saunas and steam room, and came upon the dry sauna first. A 1.2.3 style - I wish I’d had flip flops the floor was so hot. In the third room I stretched, my legs out in front and reaching/touching my head to my knees, breathing into my lower back. I was alone there, then. I stretched my arms, then meditated. While meditating, teeming sweat, I began saying the names of the close to me, as if it were an annunciation, or something I did often. My heart rippling, I left and wandered to the thermal baths after a cold shower. My towel was getting heavy. Tried the  cooler bath on the left first for a couple minutes, acclimating my body, and noticing the blue of the domed room, spotted with yellow. Over the other pool were two big cherubs, reaching up and out. I got in that pool, noticing the sun coming through the glassed-ceiling roof here, too. I sat in a corner, in that sun, once I’d seen a woman supporting a man on his back, looking up unblinking at the ceiling. At one point, another woman got in to help support him, but soon left. From my vantage point in the corner I noticed the cherubs I’d been looking at were playing on a turtle, its mouth slightly open with whatever emotions big sea turtles feel., Then I hopped in the cold pool, burying my whole body, and getting into the steam room. The steam here rose through the slated seats, where I sat cross-legged, barely seeing, until it became immediately neccesary for me to get some water. I drank from the fountains in the room with the thermal baths, where pipes had additional holes in the top so when plugged shot cold water up and onto the floor. I wandered up and outside to read and relax, first feeling the complete body high from the extreme hot and cold. Afterward, I did the dry sauna again, staying until the fifteen minute timer in the third room dropped its last grain of sand. Walking out after changing, I noticed a leak in the ceiling of the underwater walkway, and from the lobby, orientated the massage rooms on either side of the turnstyles. Then I walked out, using the door on the right. <br/><br/> The Next Bath <br/> Thursday <br/><br/> Imagine a crowded, opened up church who’s nave implored for as much sun as possible, but was instead covered in bodies, legs bent in an inverted kneel to beg the sun, a modern prayer. I was denied entry on the sauna end and went 180° around to the beauty treatment entrance. Here I met the swarm, crashing on the medicinal pews (put chemical composition here). I took my ritual in the nave long pool, then went into the maze inside. Pool after pool, I got into what I think may have been a steam room if he’d let the me close the door, then across the building, passing water aerobics, thermal baths, and the elderly until I got to the 1.2 dry sauna. Went to two, got out after a few minutes after thinking about the green mold I’d seen creeping down once-white walls from a, aptly, stone jar. Then I got in a medicinal pool, looking up at the high ceiling, dusty discs resting just below the top ,suspended in thick air. This was not the bath of the previous day, this was serious. I waded out of the bath to find a spot outside, to look at the boys. I saw a sign for another sauna after I’d had my fill, this one in the basement of the building. It was enormous. Packed at times, I jumped into the cold water afterward, dunking my head and this time breathing in deeply before. I left to sun myself and trip out again, the blood rushing god knows where, at this point. I got my snacks, returned to sit outside, and read more waves. I’d decided I’d had enough, then -- my head was already swimming more than any bath could keep up with. I returned my towel, and took a shower, realizing I’d have to air dry, outside, again. <br/><br/> The Third Bath <br/> Istanbul, 1500’s <br/><br/> These baths were contained inside a dome, too, and when I lay on the marble stone -- after coming in and paying then being directed upstairs past clothing lines of the small red and white-patchworked towels to my small cabin room -- looking up in the moderate heat I thought it might be terrible to be here if I was one of those people who feared pepperings of holes. My bather, a small older man who when he asked “English, yeah?” and I said “yeah” just opened his mouth and let out a cackle looking right in my eyes. Then he fucked my shit up. Rubbing me with such force I wrenched my face and tried to breath steadily, thinking it would have to be over at some point. then he led me off the stone into the vestibule room between the four story entrance with the cabins, the massage rooms, the showers, and the domed bath, sat me down, and continued, throwing water in my face and over my soaped up bod every once and a while. It was amazing. Then he showed me his number, 17, and showed me to the massage room where two men were giving another two, both on their stomachs, massages. One of the men, with silver hair and a curt demeanor, sat me down and applied the mud with a small, white painter’s sponge, brown from the dark clay from the white bowl. I layed down, looking at another domed ceiling with a pattern of stars and squares around a circle at the center while my clay hardened and I thought of sand on the shore and the way it dried after being put under some pressure by a foot so a wet circle forms -- from the outside in. I got up once I was told to and walked to the showers to wash the clay and return to the hot, central stone, waiting for the lines of water on my arms to turn to full drops of sweat, hanging on to my skin. I went to one of the fountains in one of the small rooms to the side and sat, turning the hot and cold faucets to varying degrees, filling the small marble basin until I could stick my metal bowl into it and throw it onto my body, again and again. After two rounds of that, I left to lay, lights off, in my small room for a moment. Then I changed, tipped my room cleaner, and went downstairs to the large lobby to drink pomegranate juice and watch the other travelers. <br/><br/>"],
