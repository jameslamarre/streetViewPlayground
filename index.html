These are recorded as modified on the WFD characterisation database and there are currently 476 such water bodies in Scotland, and 3301 in England and Wales. In order for a water body to be designated heavily modified evidence is required to show that the water body would not achieve good status without measures being applied in relation to the modifications that have been made to the hydromorphological characteristics. This paper outlines principles for the methodologies the UK will use to identify which of these bodies can be designated without the need for detailed site-specific studies. <br/><br/> To make the case for designation, evidence is required that: <br/><br/> (a) Making the hydromorphological improvements necessary to achieve good status would have a significant adverse effect on the wider environment or on a specified water use; <br/><br/> AND <br/><br/> (b) For reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, there is no significantly better environmental option to reasonably achieve the benefits provided by the modifications. If both criteria are met then the water body should be designated heavily modified. <br/><br/> } <br/><br/> By European Environment Agency (EEA) { <br/><br/>HMWB are bodies of water which as a result of physical alterations by human activity are substantially changed in character and cannot, therefore, meet good ecological status (GES). In this context physical alterations mean changes to e.g. the size, slope, discharge, form and shape of river bed of a water body. <br/><br/> Intensive agriculture, urbanisation, energy production and flood protection have altered European hydrological systems and freshwater habitats for decades. Climate change adds to these challenges (higher water temperature, more floods or water scarcity). Less than half of all water bodies have a 'good status'. <br/><br/> Full and coordinated implementation of water and nature legislation would restore aquatic habitats and foster water efficiency. <br/><br/> The natural capital of water ecosystems is highly intertwined and dependant on the way land and water is managed and how pressures from agriculture, energy, transport etc. are reduced within their respective policy areas or how adaptation to climate change is integrated into water management. <br/><br/> Urban water management has over many years used rivers only as extensions of the sewage system. Urban rivers have been covered, river banks have been heavily developed, and lakes have been isolated or even filled. Impervious sewage collection systems have changed the water flow regime. <br/><br/> }"],

			Can damming occur in the body? would it be visibly rendered on the skin, on the face? Are there dammed bodies moving among us, their movements themselves stopped and gapped -- by 50% or more?
